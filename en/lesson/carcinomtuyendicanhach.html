            <p class="lead">Adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis is a critical topic in surgical pathology,
                reflecting a common and challenging aspect of cancer diagnosis and treatment. The understanding of this
                condition is essential for medical students, especially those focusing on pathology.</p>

                <h2>Definition / General</h2>
                <p>Adenocarcinoma refers to a type of cancer that originates in the glandular tissue of the body, which
                    is found in various organs, including the lungs, breasts, pancreas, and colon. The term "with lymph
                    node metastasis" indicates that the cancer has spread from its original site to nearby lymph nodes,
                    a process known as metastasis. This spread is significant as it affects staging, treatment, and
                    prognosis.</p>

                <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
                <p>The incidence of adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis varies by the primary cancer site. For
                    example, lung and breast cancers are among the most common sources of metastatic adenocarcinoma to
                    lymph nodes. The prevalence is influenced by factors such as age, lifestyle, genetic predisposition,
                    and environmental exposures.</p>

                <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
                <p>Adenocarcinoma with lymph node metastasis involves the spread of cancer cells from the primary site
                    to lymph nodes through the lymphatic system. This spread is facilitated by the invasion of cancer
                    cells into lymphatic vessels, allowing them to travel to and colonize lymph nodes. Metastatic nodes
                    can then serve as a reservoir for further spread throughout the body.</p>

                <p>The clinical presentation can vary widely depending on the primary site of the adenocarcinoma and the
                    extent of lymph node involvement. Symptoms may include localized pain or swelling, systemic symptoms
                    such as weight loss and fatigue, and specific organ-related symptoms depending on the cancer's
                    origin.</p>

                    Imaging findings can show the primary tumor's size, location, and characteristics, as well as the presence of enlarged lymph nodes suggestive of metastasis. Advanced imaging techniques can further delineate the extent of disease spread.

                    The gross pathological examination of surgical specimens can reveal the size and appearance of the primary tumor and affected lymph nodes, which may be enlarged, firm, and sometimes adherent to surrounding tissues.

                    Microscopically, adenocarcinoma is characterized by glandular patterns of cancer cells, which may vary in differentiation. Metastatic lymph nodes show clusters of cancer cells within the lymphoid tissue. Special stains and immunohistochemical markers can help confirm the diagnosis and origin of the metastatic cells.
