              <h2>Definition / General</h2>
              <p>Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that originates in the squamous cells, which are thin, flat cells found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin, the lining of the hollow organs of the body, and the passages of the respiratory and digestive tracts. SCC is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal squamous cells, which can lead to tumors and spread to other parts of the body if not treated early.</p>

                <p>The term "Squamous Cell Carcinoma" encompasses various forms of cancer arising from squamous cells, including cutaneous SCC, which is the most common form, and SCCs of the lung, esophagus, and cervix, among others.</p>

            <section id="epidemiology">
              <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
            <p>SCC is the second most common form of skin cancer. Its incidence varies globally, largely dependent on factors such as skin type, sun exposure, and geographic location. It is more common in individuals with fair skin, older age, and those with a history of prolonged sun exposure or use of tanning beds.</p>

            <section id="pathophysiology">
              <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
              <p>The development of SCC is closely linked to DNA damage in squamous cells, often induced by UV radiation. This damage leads to mutations in genes that control cell division and death, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation. Chronic inflammation and exposure to carcinogens (e.g., tobacco smoke) are also significant contributors.</p>

                Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, are used to assess the extent of disease and are particularly important for staging and planning treatment for SCCs not located on the skin.

                Grossly, SCC may appear as a raised, ulcerated lesion with a hard base. The size can vary significantly depending on the duration and location of the tumor.
