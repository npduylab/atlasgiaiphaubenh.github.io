      <section id="Definition">
        <h2>Definition / General</h2>
        <p>Adenomyosis is a gynecological condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue (the
          tissue that lines the inside of the uterus) within the myometrium (the muscular wall of the uterus). This
          results in a diffusely enlarged uterus and can lead to symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain,
          and pressure symptoms</p>
      </section>

      <hr>

      <section id="features">
        <h2>Essential Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium</li>
          <li>Often associated with heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea</li>
          <li>Typically diagnosed in women aged 40-50 years but can occur in younger patients</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <hr>

      <section id="terminology">
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>Adenomyosis is sometimes referred to as "endometriosis interna," highlighting its nature as an inward growth
          of endometrial tissue, in contrast to endometriosis, where endometrial tissue is found outside the uterus</p>
      </section>

      <section id="epidemiology">
        <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
        <p>Adenomyosis is most commonly diagnosed in women in their 40s and 50s, although it can occur at any reproductive age. The prevalence is challenging to determine due to the necessity of histological diagnosis, but it's estimated to affect approximately 20-35% of women.</p>
      </section>
      <hr>

      <section id="pathophysiology">
        <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
        <p>The exact cause of adenomyosis remains unclear, but it is thought to involve a combination of factors, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disruption of the boundary between the endometrium and myometrium</li>
          <li>Increased estrogen levels</li>
          <li>Inflammation</li>
          <li>Uterine trauma that could result from surgery, such as cesarean delivery</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <hr>

      <section id="clinical-features">
        <h2>Clinical Features</h2>
        <p>Symptoms of adenomyosis can vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, including</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding)</li>
          <li>Dysmenorrhea (painful periods)</li>
          <li>Chronic pelvic pain</li>
          <li>Pain during intercourse</li>
          <li>Enlarged uterus palpable on physical examination</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <hr>

      <section id="diagnosis">
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Diagnosis of adenomyosis is often made through a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Definitive diagnosis requires histological examination, typically after hysterectomy.</p>
      </section>

      <hr>

      <section id="laboratory">
        <h2>Laboratory</h2>
        <p>There are no specific laboratory tests for adenomyosis. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical features and imaging</p>
      </section>

      <hr>

      <section id="radiology">
        <h2>Radiology Description</h2>
        <p>Ultrasound (especially transvaginal) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the main radiological techniques used to suggest a diagnosis of adenomyosis. MRI offers the best visualization, showing thickening of the junctional zone, cystic spaces, and high-intensity foci within the myometrium.</p>
      </section>

      <hr>

      <section id="gross-description">
        <h2>Gross Description</h2>
        <p>On gross examination, the uterus is typically enlarged and bulky. Cut sections reveal thickening of the myometrium with trabeculations and may show cystic areas corresponding to ectopic endometrial glands.</p>
      </section>

      <hr>

      <section id="microscopic">
        <h2>Microscopic (Histologic) Description</h2>
        <p>Microscopically, adenomyosis is characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, often surrounded by hypertrophic and hyperplastic myometrium. The distance of endometrial tissue more than 2.5 mm from the base of the endometrium is diagnostic.</p>
