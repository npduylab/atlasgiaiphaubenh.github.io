            <p class="lead">Sarcomas are a diverse group of cancers that arise from mesenchymal cells, which are the
                precursor cells to bones, muscles, fats, and connective tissues. They are relatively rare compared to
                carcinomas, which originate from epithelial cells. Due to their wide range of origins, sarcomas can
                develop in any part of the body, often presenting unique challenges in diagnosis and treatment.</p>

                <h2>Definition / General</h2>
                <p>Sarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from transformed cells of mesenchymal origin. This broad
                    category encompasses a wide variety of cancers, including those of bone, cartilage, fat, muscle,
                    vascular, or hematopoietic tissues. They are characterized by their tendency to arise in the
                    connective tissues of the body.</p>

                    <li>Originate from mesenchymal cells.</li>
                    <li>Can develop in bone, muscle, fat, and other connective tissues.</li>
                    <li>Distinguished by their tissue of origin, such as osteosarcoma (bone) or liposarcoma (fat).</li>

            <section id="terminology">
                <h2>Terminology</h2>
                <p>The terminology for sarcomas is usually derived from the tissue of origin, followed by the suffix "-sarcoma." For example, a sarcoma arising from bone tissue is called an "osteosarcoma," from fat tissue a "liposarcoma," and from muscle tissue either a "rhabdomyosarcoma" (striated muscle) or "leiomyosarcoma" (smooth muscle).</p>

            <section id="epidemiology">
                <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
                <p>
                    Sarcomas are rare, accounting for approximately 1% of all adult cancers and about 15% of pediatric cancers. The incidence varies by subtype, age, and location, with some types being more prevalent in certain age groups or geographic regions.

            <section id="pathophysiology">
                <h2>Pathophysiology</h2>
                <p>The pathophysiology of sarcomas involves mutations in the genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of mesenchymal cells. These mutations can be sporadic or part of inherited syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome or neurofibromatosis.</p>

            <section id="clinical-features">
                <h2>Clinical Features</h2>
                <p>Sarcomas can present with a variety of symptoms, depending on their location. Common signs include a palpable mass, pain, and swelling. However, symptoms may be non-specific, especially in the early stages, making early diagnosis challenging.</p>

            <section id="diagnosis">
                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>Diagnosis of sarcoma typically involves a combination of imaging studies, such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and PET scans, followed by a biopsy to confirm the type of sarcoma through histological examination.</p>

                <h2>Laboratory</h2>
                <p>There are no specific laboratory tests for diagnosing sarcomas, but certain markers can be elevated in some sarcoma subtypes, such as LDH in osteosarcoma.</p>

            <section id="radiology">
                <h2>Radiology Description</h2>
                <p>Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of sarcomas. Radiologic features vary widely depending on the sarcoma type but may include bone destruction, soft tissue mass, and specific patterns of calcification or necrosis.</p>

            <section id="gross-description">
                <h2>Gross Description</h2>
                <p>The gross appearance of sarcomas can vary significantly but typically presents as a well-demarcated or infiltrative mass. The color, consistency, and presence of necrosis or hemorrhage can provide clues about the subtype.</p>

            <hr>

            <section id="microscopic">
                <h2>Microscopic (Histologic) Description</h2>
                <p>Microscopically, sarcomas are characterized by the proliferation of malignant mesenchymal cells. The specific histologic appearance, including cell shape, size, and arrangement, helps in subclassifying sarcomas. For example, osteosarcomas show malignant osteoid formation, while liposarcomas demonstrate lipoblastic differentiation.</p>
